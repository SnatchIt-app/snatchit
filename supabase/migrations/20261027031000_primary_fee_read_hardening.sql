-- 20261027031000_primary_fee_read_hardening.sql — registry 188 / pgTAP 258 (A).
--
-- WHAT THIS MIGRATION IS. DRAFT / unapplied / undeployed. Body-only CREATE OR REPLACE of TWO functions at
-- their exact signatures: venue.create_primary_checkout(uuid, jsonb, uuid[], text) and
-- catalog.set_platform_config(text, jsonb, text, text). Each new body = its APPLIED predecessor (093 PART
-- "A5" for checkout, 102 PART 3 for the config writer; no migration on the stacked tree 159 -> 176 -> 160
-- -> 161 -> 162 -> 163 -> 182 -> 185 replaces either — measured with pg_get_functiondef on a clone) + marked
-- blocks. No new function, no signature change, no grant change, no table, no public-schema object;
-- Gate-2 census, grant-decision manifest and expected_grants.txt unchanged (+0). Replay-safe: CREATE OR
-- REPLACE behind an md5 pre-flight that accepts only the predecessor or this file's own body, per function.
--
-- ── THE FINDING ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
-- (a) venue.create_primary_checkout read the buyer fee rate as
--       select (c.value #>> '...')::numeric into v_fee_bps from catalog.platform_config c
--        where c.key = 'fee.buyer_service_bps' order by c.version desc limit 1;      (093:4091-4094)
--     The cast sits in an ordered target list. On a seq-scan plan it is evaluated below the Sort, on
--     EVERY version of the key, before ORDER BY / LIMIT pick the newest: one non-numeric version anywhere
--     in the append-only history raises 22P02 although the newest value is valid. On an index scan it
--     reads one row and succeeds. Pricing was plan-dependent (pgTAP 252 F17 pinned the 22P02; 258 P-pins
--     reproduce it on both plans).
-- (b) catalog.set_platform_config locks a key's JSON type only once its current value is non-null (the
--     TYPE witness, lines 68-71 of the applied body). fee.buyer_service_bps and
--     inventory.per_user_active_hold_max are both seeded JSON null (093 PART 40), so their FIRST write
--     accepted any JSON type — and the history is append-only, so a string could never be removed.
--
-- ── WHAT CHANGES (the spots marked `188 BLOCK …`) ─────────────────────────────────────────────
--   create_primary_checkout
--     D   one declared variable, v_fee_raw jsonb.
--     R1  the newest row is selected FIRST in a LIMIT subquery (never pulled up), only that value is
--         inspected, and it is cast AFTER, inside a CASE on jsonb_typeof = 'number'. A newest value that is
--         neither a number nor JSON null refuses 'precondition_failed: service_fee_unset — … is a JSON
--         <type>, not a number …' — the function's existing unset-rate code, which the primary-checkout
--         edge maps to its 503 service_fee_unset activation blocker (index.ts:549). JSON null and a missing
--         key fall through to 093's own service_fee_unset refusal, byte-identical; 093's range check
--         (service_fee_out_of_range) is untouched.
--     R1/R2  093's four-line read is KEPT byte for byte so the strip rule reproduces the predecessor, inside
--         `if false then … end if;` (R1 opens the branch, R2 closes it): it is never executed.
--   set_platform_config
--     V   after the TYPE witness and the stated RANGE checks, before the interval guard and every write:
--         fee.buyer_service_bps must be a JSON integer 0..10000 — exactly the values create_primary_checkout
--           prices with (its service_fee_out_of_range check, 093:4110-4112: < 0, > 10000 or fractional
--           refuses; the edge maps that code at index.ts:558 and has no numeric bound of its own);
--         inventory.per_user_active_hold_max must be a JSON integer >= 1 that fits an integer
--           (venue.reserve_primary_inventory reads it ::integer and fails to ZERO — every reserve refused —
--           on anything else; 0 is that same refusal).
--         "Integer" is the stored JSON text form -?[0-9]+ (750.0 is refused; write 750). Refusal style:
--         'precondition_failed: bad_value — …', like the function's other range checks. A valid fee value
--         still PARKS for a second platform_admin (fee.% dual control is unchanged); a valid hold max still
--         executes for one admin (142 H18t).
--
-- ── OUT OF SCOPE, REPORTED (not changed here) ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
--   * Two other readers keep the cast-before-limit shape: catalog.publish_event's SALEABLE gate reads
--     fee.buyer_service_bps the same way (102:435, fee_policy_unset), and venue.reserve_primary_inventory
--     reads inventory.per_user_active_hold_max ::integer inside an exception handler (a bad version
--     anywhere fails the cap to ZERO on a seq-scan plan). V stops new bad versions; a bad version already
--     in a history still reaches them.
--   * The dual-control executor (kernel.approve_refund_request, config.set_money_key arm) writes the
--     parked proposed_value without re-validating it: a request parked BEFORE 188 with a bad fee value can
--     still be approved after it.
--
-- ── GRANTS / FOUR-FILE RULE ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
-- CREATE OR REPLACE keeps owner, proacl, prosecdef and proconfig; nothing is restated. The CI grant gates
-- read `public` only: no manifest row, no expected_grants line, Gate-2 census +0. The post-apply self-check
-- asserts definer, search_path and the exact ACLs captured by the pre-flight.

  -- ---- A8 / F §3.5 gate G2 — PAYOUT READINESS, FAIL CLOSED -----------------
  -- The organization whose event this is must have a BOUND destination AND a
  -- live `transfers` capability. Under Ruling A1/A2 the platform is merchant of
  -- record and the organization is paid later by POST /v1/transfers, so
  -- `transfers` active is what makes that transfer legal — F §3.5 rules that
  -- payouts_enabled is explicitly NOT part of this predicate (an organization
  -- that can be transferred to but cannot yet reach its bank keeps selling; the
  -- money rests in their Stripe balance and no ticket is harmed).
  -- Both operands are required: a bound ref with a dead capability is not
  -- ready, and a live-looking flag with no ref has nowhere to send money. The
  -- org row is read WITHOUT a lock on purpose — checkout moves no money, and
  -- 085's finalize is the authoritative money moment; taking a row lock on the
  -- organization here would serialize every buyer in the venue behind one row.
  --
  -- THIS READ IS LEGAL AND NEEDS NO GRANT — DO NOT "FIX" IT BY WIDENING ONE.
  -- kernel.organization revokes everything from `authenticated` and grants back
  -- only (org_id, display_name, status) (077:133-138), so a BUYER cannot read
  -- stripe_connect_account_ref or the §1 columns. This function is SECURITY
  -- DEFINER: it executes as the function owner, not as the caller, so the
  -- client-side revoke does not apply to it and the select below succeeds for
  -- every buyer without any column ever becoming client-readable. That is the
  -- whole design — the gate reads privileged state, the caller cannot. Anyone
  -- who "fixes" a permission error here by granting `authenticated` SELECT on
  -- these columns has published the payout destination of every organization
  -- on the platform to every signed-in user. The read path for humans is
  -- kernel.get_org_connect_state (§6), which masks the account id.
  select o.stripe_connect_account_ref, o.connect_transfers_active, o.status
    into v_org_ref, v_org_ready, v_org_status
    from kernel.organization o
   where o.org_id = v_org_id;

  -- G2a — ORGANIZATION STATUS, AND IT IS CHECKED FIRST.
  -- A suspended organization could sell: this function read kernel.organization
  -- for two columns and never consulted `status`, so a suspended org with a
  -- bound acct_, transfers active and a live signing key refused only on the
  -- fee key. That is inconsistent with 093's own posture — this same migration
  -- added status ∈ ('approved','active') to BOTH Connect binders (§4, §5) and to
  -- the dashboard read verb (§6), on the reasoning that an organization the
  -- platform has suspended must not move money or name a payee. SELLING is the
  -- money-path entry that was left out, and it is the exact twin of the gap the
  -- rest of this slice closed.
  --
  -- ORDERED BEFORE THE CONNECT GATE, DELIBERATELY — this is the one place my
  -- ladder diverges from the one specified, and it is the divergence that was
  -- asked for: the more FUNDAMENTAL fact should win the error. "This
  -- organization is suspended" explains the refusal completely and is actionable
  -- by exactly one party (the platform, via kernel.set_org_status). Leading with
  -- `payout_not_ready` would send an operator to re-check Stripe — where they
  -- would find nothing wrong, because nothing is — for a condition Stripe has no
  -- part in. A suspended org that is ALSO not connect-ready should still report
  -- the suspension, because resolving the Connect side would not make it
  -- sellable.
  --
  -- FAILS CLOSED ON NULL. A null status covers the org row having vanished
  -- (SELECT INTO leaves every target null when no row matches), which is
  -- stricter than the previous behaviour: that case used to fall through to
  -- `payout_not_ready`, which was accidentally correct rather than deliberately.
  -- Any status outside the pair — 'applied', 'suspended', 'closed', or anything
  -- a later migration adds — refuses. X-12 restrictive: unknown authorizes
  -- NOTHING.
  --
  -- SCOPE, FOR THE RECORD, since this lands late in 093's life: 093 has never
  -- reached production; this is the same primary-ticketing atomic contract; it
  -- adds NO object and NO column, being a body-only CREATE OR REPLACE of a
  -- function 093 already replaces for G2/G2b/A5. THE OBJECT CENSUS DOES NOT
  -- MOVE: this change creates nothing, so whatever the slice's object count is
  -- at assembly time, this clause does not alter it.

  -- ---- A8 / G2b — SIGNING-KEY DELIVERABILITY, FAIL CLOSED -----------------
  -- THE DEFECT THIS CLOSES: with ZERO signing keys in the database an order was
  -- created, the buyer paid, the webhook called venue.finalize_primary_order,
  -- and the mint raised `no_active_signing_key` (083:513-530) — AFTER the
  -- PaymentIntent was confirmed. The buyer is charged and holds no ticket, and
  -- with the refund executor undeployed and kernel.mark_refund_state without a
  -- caller, nothing gives the money back automatically. G2 asks whether the
  -- VENUE can be paid; this asks whether the BUYER can be delivered to. The
  -- owner's SALEABLE rule covers both: do not sell what Snatch It cannot
  -- honour, and a sale that provably cannot mint a ticket is the clearest case.
  --
  -- THE PREDICATE IS COPIED FROM THE MINT, NOT APPROXIMATED. A gate looser than
  -- the mint's would pass here and fail there, which is the bug being closed —
  -- so this is venue.finalize_primary_order's own resolution (085:1948-1960)
  -- character for character: active status, inside [not_before, not_after), and
  -- a scope that GOVERNS this event, ordered MOST SPECIFIC FIRST — per_event
  -- outranks per_venue outranks global. 083:517-527 then re-validates the
  -- pinned key with the identical conditions, so a key this finds is a key the
  -- mint accepts.
  --
  -- The `order by … limit 1` is retained even though a bare EXISTS would be

  -- visibly the SAME query as finalize's, so a future change to the precedence
  -- there is an obvious mismatch here rather than a silent divergence.

  -- 093 applies and stays on until the ruling-B bootstrap key row exists — the
  -- owner ceremony (093 scope item 2) — which is the correct resting state:
  -- until that row exists, no ticket can be minted by anything.
  --
  -- NOTHING HERE PROVISIONS A KEY. Ruling B parks kernel.provision_signing_key

  -- 093 / ruling A5 — `fee.%` ADDED. This is the ONLY change to this function.
  -- WHY: fee.buyer_service_bps is the final clause of the SALEABLE chain — the

  -- and a gate audit proved three preconditions behind it are unenforced (no
  -- active signing key is required at checkout, refund executability is checked
  -- nowhere, and no tax model exists at all). A single administrator crossing
  -- that line in one un-parked statement is exactly the shape the owner banned:
  -- a config value acting as a hidden feature flag for incomplete logic.
  -- WHY THE PREFIX AND NOT A RENAME: the settlement maturity key was fixed by
  -- renaming it into `payout.%`; that is REJECTED here because this is not a
  -- payout key and the rename would reintroduce the misleading semantics the
  -- maturity rename removed. The prefix list is a policy statement about which
  -- NAMESPACES are money-critical, and buyer-facing pricing plainly is.
  -- 093 / H2 — `deletion.%` ADDED, for the same reason and by the same test.
  -- deletion.post_event_hold_hours decides when an identity becomes
  -- IRREVERSIBLY tombstoned while money obligations on their orders can still
  -- arise. G7 P1-4 executed the gap: as one platform_admin with an aal2 claim,
  -- `set_platform_config('deletion.refund_possible_window_hours', …)` returned
  -- `{"status":"ok"}` with no second human, and that single statement is what
  -- turned P0-3 from a design flaw into a one-statement act. `deletion.%`
  -- matched none of the prefixes below. It does now.
  -- WHY THE PREFIX AND NOT A RENAME INTO `refund.%`/`payout.%`: the same
  -- argument the `fee.%` note above makes. This is not a refund key and not a
  -- payout key; filing it under either would restore exactly the collapsed
  -- semantics — refund ELIGIBILITY vs payout MATURITY vs DELETION SAFETY — that
  -- G2's rename and H2's re-anchor both exist to take apart.
  -- 093 / H2 — `ticket.%` ADDED. The LAST destructive key family outside this list.
  -- The evidence is G1 §7 and the seed comment at the top of this file, and it is
  -- stronger than the case for several keys already here: setting
  -- `ticket.expiry_grace` wrongly does not DEGRADE, it writes the TERMINAL label
  -- `expired` across every atom on every ended session within one cron tick
  -- (079:456, cron */2 at 079:799-803) — and 088:1682/1735/1783 then EXCLUDE
  -- expired atoms from catalog.cancel_event's refund cascade, so the holder loses
  -- the ticket AND the money. There is no exit: no shipped function writes
  -- kernel.tickets.state back out of `expired`. A single administrator must not be
  -- able to cross that boundary alone, for the same reason `fee.%` (ruling A5) and
  -- `deletion.%` (H2) were added — an irreversible money or identity boundary takes
  -- two humans.
  -- NOTE the two controls are INDEPENDENT and both still apply. The interval TYPE
  -- guard above already refuses a bare number on this key (it is first in that
  -- list), which is what stops the '24' => TWENTY-FOUR SECONDS cast; dual control
  -- is the separate question of who may set a WELL-TYPED but wrong value. Neither
  -- shadows the other: a mistyped value is refused outright and never parks, and a
  -- well-typed one parks.
  -- `ticket.%` has NO entry in the polarity map below, so it takes §20.2.1's third
  -- arm — not comparable => PARK — in BOTH directions. That is intended and is the
  -- correct default here: the corpus declares no restrictive direction for a grace
  -- that is destructive when short and merely slow when long, so failing toward the
  -- approver is the honest reading.
  -- 102 / owner §21 — `signing.expected_key_fingerprint` and
